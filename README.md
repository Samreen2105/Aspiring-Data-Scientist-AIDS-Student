# Aspiring-Data-Scientist-AIDS-Student
👩‍🎓 About Me

I’m an undergraduate student pursuing Artificial Intelligence & Data Science. I have a strong interest in backend development and enjoy building systems that support real-world applications. I’m currently working on developing backend services using Python, Flask, and MongoDB, and I’m eager to integrate AI concepts into scalable backend solutions.

🎯 Why I Want to Join This Project

As an AIDS student, I aim to connect backend systems with AI-driven functionalities. I’m particularly interested in how applications manage real-time user actions (like login, cart updates, and checkout) while maintaining security and performance. I want to strengthen my backend skills and apply data science knowledge to build intelligent systems.

🧠 What I Know

Programming Languages: C, Java, Python

Tools: Visual Studio Code, GitHub

Frontend Basics: HTML

Currently Learning: Flask, MongoDB, REST APIs


🚀 Goals for This Project

Learn how RESTful APIs work

Build backend features like login, product handling, and checkout

Implement authentication using JWT and bcrypt in Python

Deploy backend applications

Apply AI models in backend pipelines (as a future enhancement)
